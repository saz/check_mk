1.1.8:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * setup.sh: turn off Python debugging
    * Cleaned up documentation directory
    * cluster host: use real IP address for host check if cluster has
      one (e.g. service IP address)

    Checks & Agents:
    * Added missing PNP template for check_mk-hr_cpu
    * hr_fs: inventory now ignores filesystem with size 0,
      check does not longer crash on filesystems with size 0
    * logwatch: Fixed typo in 'too many unacknowledged logs' error message
    * ps: fix bug: inventory with fixed user name now correctly puts
      that user name into the resulting check - not None.
    * ps: inventory with GRAB_USER: service description may contain
      %u. That will be replaced with the user name and thus makes the
      service description unique.
    * win_dhcp_pools: better handle invalid agent output
    * hp_proliant_psu: Fixed multiple PSU detection on one system (Thanks to Andreas DÃ¶hler)
    * megaraid_pdisks: Fixed coding error

    * Prohibit { and } in regular expressions. This avoids a segmentation
      fault caused by regcomp in glibc for certain (very unusual) regular
      expressions.
    * Table status: new columns external_command_buffer_slots,
      external_command_buffer_usage and external_command_buffer_max
      (this was implemented according to an idea and special request of
       Heinz Fiebig. Please sue him if this breaks anything for you. I was
       against it, but he thinks that it is absolutely neccessary to have
       this in version 1.1.8...)
    * Table status: new columns external_commands and external_commands_rate
      (also due to Mr. Fiebig - he would have quit our workshop otherwise...)
    * Table downtimes/comments: new column is_service

    Multisite:
    * Snapin Performance: show external command per second and usage and
      size of external command buffer
    * Downtimes view: Group by hosts and services - just like comments
    * Fix links for items containing + (e.g. service descriptionen including
      spaces)
    * Allow non-ASCII character in downtimes and comments
    * Added nagvis_base_url to multisite.mk example configuration
    * Filter for host/service groups: use name instead of alias if 
      user has no permissions for groups

1.1.8b3:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Added some Livestatus LQL examples to documentation
    * Removed cleanup_autochecks.py. Please use check_mk -u now.

      direction (thanks Daniel Nauck for his precise investigation)

    Checks & Agents:
    * New check imm_health by Michael Nieporte
    * rsa_health: fix bug: detection of WARNING state didn't work (was UNKNOWN
            instead)
    * check_mk_agent.solaris: statgrab now excludes filesystems. This avoids hanging
      in case of an NFS problem. Thanks to Divan Santana.

      header (found by Sven Nierlein)
    * fix invalid json output for empty responses (found by Sven Nierlein)
    * fix Stats: avg ___ for 0 matching elements. Output was '-nan' and is
      now '0.0'
    * fix output of floating point numbers: always use exponent and make
      sure a decimal point is contained (this makes JSON/Python detect
      the correct type)

1.1.7i5:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * SNMP: do not load any MIB files (speeds up snmpwalk a lot!)

    * install_nagios.sh: correctly detect Ubuntu 10.04.1
    * Config output: make order of service deterministic
    * fix problem with missing default hostgroup

    Multisite:
    * Sidebar: Improved the quicksearch snapin. It can search for services, 
      servicegroups and hostgroups now. Simply add a prefix "s:", "sg:" or "hg:"
      to search for other objects than hosts.
    * View editor: fix bug which made it impossible to add more than 10 columns
    * Service details: for Check_MK checks show description from check manual in

      to False in order to hide error about unreachable sites
    * hiding views: new configuration variables hidden_views and visible_views
    * View "Service problems": hide problems of down or unreachable hosts. This
      makes the view consistant with "Tactical Overview"

    Checks & Agents:
    * Two new checks: akcp_sensor_humidity and akcp_sensor_temp (Thanks to Michael Nieporte)
    * PNP-template for kernel: show average of displayed range
    * ntp and ntp.time: Inventory now per default just creates checks for ntp.time (summary check).
      This is controlled by the new variable ntp_inventory_mode (see check manuals).
    * 3ware: Three new checks by Radoslav Bak: 3ware_disks, 3ware_units, 3ware_info
    * nvidia: agent now only queries GPUCoreTemp and GPUErrors. This avoids
      a vmalloc leakage of 32kB per call (bug in NVIDIA driver)
    * Make all SNMP based checks independent of standard MIB files
    * ad_replication: Fixed syntax errors and unhandled date output when
      not replicated yet

    * if64/if: Removing all null bytes during hex string parsing (These signs Confuse nagios pipe)
    * Fixed hr_mem and hr_fs checks to work with new SNMP format
    * ups_*: Inventory works now on Riello UPS systems
    * ups_power: Working arround wrong implemented RFC in some Riello UPS systems (Fixing negative power
      consumption values)
    * FreeBSD Agent: Added sections: df mount mem netctr ipmitool (Thanks to Florian Heigl)
    * AIX: exclude NFS and CIFS from df (thanks to JÃ¶rg Linge)
    * cisco_locif: Using the interface index as item when no interface name or description are set

    Livestatus:
    * table columns: fix type of num_service_* etc.: was list, is now int (thanks to Gerhard LauÃer)

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Fixed automatic creation of host contactgroups
    * templates: make PNP links work without rewrite

      the Multisite frame work and thus using Multisite for other tasks as
      well.
    * status_host: new state "waiting", if status host is still pending
    * make PNP links work without rewrite
    * Fix visibility problem: in multisite setups all users could see

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Fix extra_nagios_conf: did not work in 1.1.7i2
    * Service Check_MK now displays overall processing time including
      agent communication and adds this as performance data
    * Fix bug: define_contactgroups was always assumed True. That led to duplicate
      definitions in case of manual definitions in Nagios 

    Checks & Agents:
    * New Check: hp_proliant_da_phydrv for monitoring the state of physical disks
      in HP Proliant Servers

      Check_MK does not longer define timeperiod definitions. Please
      define them manually in Nagios.
    * host_notification_period has been removed. Use host_extra_conf["notification_period"]
      instead. Same holds for service_notification_periods, summary_host_notification_periods
      and summary_service_notification_periods.
    * Removed modes -H and -S for creating config data. This now does
      the new option -N. Please set generate_hostconf = False if you
      want only services to be defined.

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * New config option usewalk_hosts, triggers --usewalk during
      normal checking for selected hosts.
    * new option --scan-parents for automatically finding and 
      configuring parent hosts (see online docu for details)
    * inventory check: put detailed list of unchecked items into long
      plugin output (to be seen in status details)
    * New configuration variable check_parameters, that allows to
      override default parameters set by inventory, without defining 
      manual checks!

      in heartbeat clusters using the CRM
    * *nix agents: output AgentOS: in header
    * New agent for FreeBSD: It is based on the linux agent. Most of the sections
      could not be ported easily so the FreeBSD agent provides information for less
      checks than the linux agent.
    * heartbeat_crm and heartbeat_crm.resources: Change handling of check parameters.
      Please reinvenurize and read the updated man page of those checks

      in sites, use current Livestatus version)

    Livestatus:
    * Fix problems with in_*_period. Introduce global
      timeperiod cache. This also improves performance
    * Table timeperiods: new column 'in' which is 0/1 if/not the
      timeperiod is currently active
    * New module option idle_timeout. It sets the time in ms
      Livestatus waits for the next query. Default is 300000 ms (5 min).
    * New module option query_timeout. It limits the time between
      two lines of a query (in ms). Default is 10000 ms (10 sec).

    * New option -u for reordering autochecks in per-host-files
      (please refer to updated documentation about inventory for

      security name and password instead of a string in snmp_communities
      for V3 hosts.
    * SNMP: Fixed hexstring detection on empty strings
    * New option -II: Is like -I, but removes all previous autochecks
      from inventorized hosts
    * install_nagios.sh: Fix detection of PNP4Nagios URL and URL of
      NagVis
    * Packager: make sanity check prohibiting creating of package files
      in Check MK's directories
    * install_nagios.sh: Support Ubuntu 10.04 (Thanks to Ben)
      
    Checks & Agents:
    * New check ntp.time: Similar to 'ntp' but only honors the system peer
      (that NTP peer where ntpq -p prints a *).

    * Linux: new check nvidia.temp for monitoring temperature of NVIDIA graphics card
    * Linux: avoid free-ipmi hanging forever on hardware that does not support IPMI
    * SNMP: Instead of an artificial index column, which some checks use, now
      the last component of the OID is used as index. That means that inventory
      will find new services and old services will become UNKNOWN. Please remove
      the outdated checks.
    * if: handle exception on missing OIDs
    * New checks hp_blade* - Checking health of HP BladeSystem Enclosures via SNMP
    * New check drbd - Checking health of drbd nodes

    * Fix problems with Umlauts (non-Ascii-characters) in performance data
    * New context view: all services of a host group
    * Sidebar snapins can now fetch URLs for the snapin content instead of
      building the snapin contents on their own.
    * Added new nagvis_maps snapin which displays all NagVis maps available
      to the user. Works with NagVis 1.5 and newer.

1.1.6:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Service aggregation: new config option aggregation_output_format.
      Settings this to "multiline" will produce Nagios multiline output
      with one line for each individual check.

    Multisite:
    * New painter for long service plugin output (Currently not used
      by any builtin view)

    Checks & Agents:

    * New option --donate for donating live host data to the community.
      Please refer to the online documentation for details.
    * Tactical Overview: Fixed refresh timeout typo
      (Was 16 mins instead of 10 secs)

    Livestatus:
    * Assume strings are UTF-8 encoded in Nagios. Convert from latin-1 only
      on invalid UTF-8 sequences (thanks to Alexander Yegorov)

    Multisite:
    * Correctly display non-ascii characters (fixes exception with 'ascii codec')
      (Please also update Livestatus to 1.1.6rc3)

1.1.6rc2:
    Multisite:
    * Fix bug in Master control: other sites vanished after klicking buttons.
      This was due to connection error detection in livestatus.py (Bug found
      by Benjamin Odenthal)
    * Add theme and baseurl to links to PNP (using features of new PNP4Nagios
      0.6.4)

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * snmp: hopefully fix HEX/string detection now

    Checks & Agents:
    * md: fix inventory bug on resync=PENDING (Thanks to Darin Perusich)

1.1.6rc1:
    Multisite:
    * Repair Perf-O-Meters on webkit based browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari)
    * Repair layout on IE7/IE8. Even on IE6 something is working (definitely
      not transparent PNGs though). Thanks to Lars.
    * Display host state correct if host is pending (painter "host with state")
    * Logfile: new filter for plugin output
    * Improve dialog flow when cloning views (button [EDIT] in views snapin)
    * Quicksearch: do not open search list if text did not change (e.g. Shift up),
      close at click into field or snapin.

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Included three patched from Jeff Dairiki dealing with compile flags
      and .gitignore removed from tarballs
    * Fix problem with clustered_services_of[]: services of one cluster
      appeared also on others
    * Packager: handle broken files in package dir
    * snmp handling: better error handling in cases where multiple tables
      are merged (e.g. fc_brocade_port_detailed)
    * snmp: new handling of unprintable strings: hex dumps are converted
      into binary strings now. That way all strings can be displayed and
      no information is lost - nevertheless.
      
    Checks & Agents:
    * Solaris agent: fixed rare df problems on Solaris 10, fix problem with test -f
      (thanks to Ulf Hoffmann)
    * Converted all PNP templates to format of 0.6.X. Dropped compatibility
      with 0.4.X.
    * Do not use ipmi-sensors if /dev/ipmi0 is missing. ipmi-sensors tries
      to fiddle around with /dev/mem in that case and miserably fails
      in some cases (infinite loop)
    * fjdary60_run: use new binary encoding of hex strings
    * if64: better error handling for cases where clients do not send all information
    * apc_symmetra: handle status 'smart boost' as OK, not CRITICAL

    Livestatus:
    * Delay starting of threads (and handling of socket) until Nagios has
      started its event loop. This prevents showing services as PENDING 
      a short time during program start.

1.1.6b3:
    Multisite:
    * Quicksearch: hide complete host list if field is emptied via Backspace or Del.
      Also allow handle case where substring match is unique.

    * Grab & Move for sidebar scrolling (thanks to Lars)
    * Filter out summary hosts in most views.
    * Set browser refresh to 30 secs for most views
    * View host status: added a lot of missing information
    * View service status: also added information here
    * Make sure, enough columns can be selected in view editor

        service states did not work
      * Fix two bugs in df_netapp: use 64 bit counters
        (32 counter wrap at 2TB filesystems) and exclude
       	snapshot filesystems with size 0 from inventory.
      * Rudimentary support for monitoring ESX: monitor
        virtual filesystems with 'vdf' (using normal df
	check of check_mk) and monitor state of machines 
	with vcbVmName -s any (new check vmware_state).
      * Fixed bug in MRPE: check failed on empty performance
        data (e.g. from check_snmp: there is emptyness
        after the pipe symbol sometimes)
      * MK Livestatus is now multithreaded an can
        handle up to 10 parallel connections (might
        be configurable in a future version).

        if logwatch.state is missing or not including the
	file (this is easier for testing)
      * Added missing float columns to Livestatus.
      * Livestatus: new header StatsGroupBy:
      * First version with "Check_MK Livestatus Module"!

	when asked by setup.
      * New Option --paths shows all installation, config
        and data paths of Check_mk and Nagios

      * Multiadmin filter for check_command is now a drop down list.
      * Dummy commands output error message when passive services
        are actively checked (by accident)
      * New configuration option service_descriptions allows to
        define customized service descriptions for each check type
      * New configuration options extra_host_conf, extra_summary_host_conf
        and extra_service_conf allow to define arbitrary Nagios options
	in host and service defitions (notes, icon_image, custom variables,
        etc)
      * Fix bug: honor only_hosts also at option -C


1.0.39:
      * New configuration variable only_hosts allows
	you to limit check_mk to a subset of your
	hosts (for testing)

	sends more performance data on Linux (see 
	check manual for details)
      * many improvements of Multiadmin web pages: optionally 
	filter out services which are (not) currently in downtime
	(host or service itself), optionally (not) filter out summary
	hosts, show host status (down hosts), new action
	for removing all scheduled downtimes of a service.
	Search results will be refreshed every 90 seconds.
	Choose between two different sorting orders.
	Multadmin now also supports user authentication
      * New configuration option define_timeperiods, which
	allows to create Nagios timeperiod definitions.
	This also enables the Multiadmin tools to filter
	out services which are currently not in their
	notification interval.
      * NIC check for Linux (netctr.combined) now supports
	checking of error rates
      * fc_brocade_port: New possibility of monitoring
	CRC errors and C3 discards
      * Fixed bug: snmp_info_single was missing
        in precompiled host checks
	
1.0.38:
      * New: check_mk's multiadmin tool (Python based
	web page). It allows mass administration of
	services (enable/disable checks/notifications, 
	acknowledgements, downtimes). It does not need
	Nagios service- or host groups but works with
	a freeform search.
      * Remove duplicate <?php from the four new 
	PNP templates of 1.0.37.
      * Linux Agent: Kill hanging NFS with signal 9
	(signal 15 does not always help)
      * Some improvements in autodetection. Also make
	debug mode: ./autodetect.py: This helps to
	find problems in autodetection.
      * New configuration variables generate_hostconf and
	generate_dummy_commands, which allows to suppress
	generation of host definitions for Nagios, or 
	dummy commands, resp.
      * Now also SNMP based checks use cache files.
      * New major options --backup and --restore for
	intelligent backup and restore of configuration
	and runtime data
      * New variable simulation_mode allows you to dry
	run your Nagios with data from another installation.
      * Fixed inventory of Linux cpu.loads and cpu.threads
      * Fixed several examples in checks manpages
      * Fixed problems in install_nagios_on_lenny.sh
      * ./setup.sh now understands option --yes: This
        will not output anything except error messages
	and assumes 'yes' to all questions
      * Fix missing 'default.php' in templates for
	local
	
1.0.37:
      * IMPORTANT: Semantics of check "cpu.loads" has changed.
	Levels are now regarded as *per CPU*. That means, that
	if your warning level is at 4.0 on a 2 CPU machine, then 
	a level of 8.0 is applied.
      * On check_mk -v now also ouputs version of check_mk
      * logfile_patterns can now contain host specific entries.
	Please refer to updated online documentation for details.
      * Handling wrapping of performance counters. 32 and 64 bit
	counters should be autodetected and handled correctly.
	Counters wrapping over twice within one check cycle
	cannot be handled, though.
      * Fixed bug in diskstat: Throughput was computed twice
	too high, since /proc/diskstats counts in sectors (512 Bytes)
	not in KB
      * The new configuration variables bulkwalk_hosts and
	non_bulkwalk_hosts, that allow 	to specify, which hosts 
	support snmpbulkwalk (which is
	faster than snmpwalk) and which not. In previos versions,
	always bulk walk was used, but some devices do not support
	that.
      * New configuration variable non_aggregated_hosts allows
	to exclude hosts generally from service aggregation.
      * New SNMP based check for Rittal CMC TC 
	(ComputerMultiControl-TopConcept) Temperature sensors 
      * Fixed several problems in autodetection of setup
      * Fixed inventory check: exit code was always 0
	for newer Python versions.
      * Fixed optical problem in check manual pages with
	newer version of less.
      * New template check_mk-local.php that tries to
	find and include service name specific templates.
	If none is found, default.php will be used.
      * New PNP templates check_mk-kernel.php for major page
	faults, context switches and process creation
      * New PNP template for cpu.threads (Number of threads)
      * Check nfsmounts now detects stale NFS handles and
	triggers a warning state in that case

1.0.36:
      * New feature of Linux/UNIX Agent: "MRPE" allows
	you to call Nagios plugins by the agent. Please
	refer to online documentation for details.
      * Fix bug in logwatch.php: Logfiles names containing spaces
	now work.
      * Setup.sh now automatically creates cfg_dir if
	none found in nagios.cfg (which is the case for the
	default configuration of a self compiled Nagios)
      * Fix computation of CPU usage for VMS.
      * snmp_hosts now allows config-list syntax. If you do
	not define snmp_hosts at all, all hosts with tag
	'snmp' are considered to be SNMP hosts. That is 
	the new preferred way to do it. Please refer
	to the new online documentation.
      * snmp_communities now also allows config-list syntax
	and is compatible to datasource_programs. This allows
	to define different SNMP communities by making use
	of host tags.
      * Check ifoperstatus: Monitoring of unused ports is
	now controlled via ifoperstatus_monitor_unused.
      * Fix problem in Windows-Agent with cluster filesystems:
	temporarily non-present cluster-filesystems are ignored by
	the agent now.
      * Linux agent now supports /dev/cciss/d0d0... in section
	<<<diskstat>>>
      * host configuration for Nagios creates now a variable
	'name host_$HOSTNAME' for each host. This allows
	you to add custom Nagios settings to specific hosts
	in a quite general way.
      * hosts' parents can now be specified with the
	variable 'parents'. Please look at online documentation
	for details.
      * Summary hosts now automatically get their real host as a
	parent. This also holds for summary cluster hosts.
      * New option -X, --config-check that checks your configuration
	for invalid variables. You still can use your own temporary
	variables if you prefix them with an underscore.
	IMPORTANT: Please check your configuration files with
	this option. The check may become an implicit standard in
	future versions.
      * Fixed problem with inventory check on older Python 
	versions.
      * Updated install_nagios_on_lenny.sh to Nagios version
	3.2.0 and fixed several bugs.

1.0.35:
      * New option -R/--restart that does -S, -H and -C and
	also restarts Nagios, but before that does a Nagios
	config check. If that fails, everything is rolled
	back and Nagios keeps running with the old configuration.
      * PNP template for PING which combines RTA and LOSS into
	one graph.
      * Host check interval set to 1 in default templates.
      * New check for hanging NFS mounts (currently only
	on Linux)
      * Changed check_mk_templates.cfg for PING-only hosts:
	No performance data is processed for the PING-Check
	since the PING data is already processed via the
	host check (avoid duplicate RRDs)
      * Fix broken notes_url for logwatch: Value from setup.sh
	was ignored and always default value taken.
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_port to agent_port
	(please updated main.mk if you use that variable)
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_min_version to
	agent_min_version (update main.mk if used)
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_autochecksdir to 
	autochecksdir (update main.mk if used)
      * configuration directory for Linux/UNIX agents is
	now configurable (default is /etc/check_mk)
      * Add missing configuration variable to precompiled
	checks (fix problem when using clusters)
      * Improved multipath-check: Inventory now determines
	current number of paths. And check output is more
	verbose.
      * Mark config files as config files in RPM. RPM used
	to overwrite main.mk on update!
	
1.0.34:
      * Ship agents for AIX and SunOS/Solaris (beta versions).
      * setup script now autodetects paths and settings of your
	running Nagios
      * Debian package of check_mk itself is now natively build
	with paths matching the prepackaged Nagios on Debian 5.0
      * checks/df: Fix output of check: percentage shown in output
	did include reserved space for root where check logic did
	not. Also fix logic: account reserved space as used - not
	as avail.
      * checks/df: Exclude filesystems with size 0 from inventory.
      * Fix bug with host tags in clusters -> precompile did not
	work.
      * New feature "Inventory Check": Check for new services. Setting
	inventory_check_interval=120 in main.mk will check for new services
	every 2 hours on each host. Refer to online documentation
	for more details.
      * Fixed bug: When agent sends invalid information or check
	has bug, check_mk now handles this gracefully
      * Fixed bug in checks/diskstat and in Linux agent. Also
	IDE disks are found. The inventory does now work correctly
	if now disks are found.
      * Determine common group of Apache and Nagios at setup.
	Auto set new variable www_group which replaces logwatch_groupid.
	Fix bug: logwatch directories are now created with correct
	ownership when check_mk is called manually as root.
      * Default templates: notifications options for hosts and
	services now include also recovery, flapping and warning
	events.
      * Windows agent: changed computation of RAM and SWAP usage
	(now we assume that "totalPageFile" includes RAM *and*
	SWAP).
      * Fix problem with Nagios configuration files: remove
	characters Nagios considers as illegal from service
	descriptions.
      * Processing of performance data (check_icmp) for host
        checks and PING-only-services now set to 1 in default
	templates check_mk_templates.cfg.
      * New SNMP checks for querying FSC ServerView Agent: fsc_fans,
	fsc_temp and fsc_subsystems. Successfully tested with agents
	running	on Windows and Linux.
      * RPM packaged agent tested to be working on VMWare ESX 4.0 
	(simply install RPM package with rpm -i ... and open port 
	in firewall with "esxcfg-firewall -o 6556,tcp,in,check_mk")
      * Improve handling of cache files: inventory now uses cache
	files only if they are current and if the hosts are not
	explicitely specified.
	
1.0.33:
      * Made check_mk run on Python 2.3.4 (as used in CentOS 4.7
	und RedHat 4.7). 
      * New option -M that prints out manual pages of checks.
	Only a few check types are documented yet, but more will
	be following.
      * Package the empty directory /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
	and ../local into the RPM and DEB package of the agent
      * New feature: service_dependencies. check_mk lets you comfortably
	create Nagios servicedependency definitions for you and also
	supports them by executing the checks in an optimal order.
      * logwatch.php: New button for hiding the context messages.
	This is a global setting for all logfiles and its state is
	stored in a cookie.
	
1.0.32:
      * IMPORTANT: Configuration variable datasource_programs is now
        analogous to that of host_groups. That means: the order of
        program and hostlist must be swapped!
      * New option --fake-dns, useful for tests with non-existing
	hosts.
      * Massive speed improvement for -S, -H and -C
      * Fixed bug in inventory of clusters: Clustered services where
	silently dropped (since introduction of host tags). Fixed now.
      * Fixed minor bug in inventory: Suppress DNS lookup when using
	--no-tcp
      * Fixed bug in cluster handling: Missing function strip_tags()
	in check_mk_base.py was eliminated.
      * Changed semantics of host_groups, summary_host_groups,
	host_contactgroups, and summary_host_groups for clusters. 
	Now the cluster names will be relevant, not
	the names of the nodes. This allows the cluster hosts to
	have different host/contactgroups than the nodes. And it is more
	consistent with other parts of the configuration.
      * Fixed bug: datasource_programs on cluster nodes did not work
	when precompiling

1.0.31:
      * New option -D, --dump that dumps all configuration information
	about one, several or all hosts
	New config variables 'ignored_checktypes' and 'ignored_services',
        which allow to include certain checktypes in general or
        some services from some hosts from inventory
      * Config variable 'clustered_services' now has the same semantics
	as ignored_checktypes and allows to make it host dependent.
      * Allow magic tags PHYSICAL_HOSTS, CLUSTER_HOSTS and ALL_HOSTS at
	all places, where lists of hosts are expected (except checks).
	This fixes various problems that arise when using all_hosts at
	those places:
	  * all_hosts might by changed by another file in conf.d
	  * all_hosts does not contain the cluster hosts
      * Config file 'final.mk' is read after all other config files -
	if it exists. You can put debug code there that prints the
	contents of your variables.
      * Use colored output only, if stdout is a tty. If you have
	problems with colors, then you can pipe the output
	through cat or less
      * Fixed bug with host tags: didn't strip off tags when
	processing configuration lists (occurs when using
	custom host lists)
      * mk_logwatch is now aware of inodes of logfiles. This
	is important for fast rotating files: If the inode
	of a logfile changes between two checks mk_logwatch
	assumes that the complete content is new, even if
	the new file is longer than the old one.
      * check_mk makes sure that you do not have duplicate
	hosts in all_hosts or clusters.

1.0.30:
      * Windows agent now automatically monitors all existing
	event logs, not only "System" and "Application".

1.0.29:
      * Improved default Nagios configuration file:
	added some missing templates, enter correct URLs
	asked at setup time.
      * IMPORANT: If you do not use the new default 
	Nagios configuration file you need to rename
	the template for aggregated services (summary
	services) to check_mk_summarizes (old name
	was 'check_mk_passive-summary'). Aggregated
	services are *always* passive and do *never*
	have performance data.
      * Hopefully fixed CPU usage output on multi-CPU
	machines
      * Fixed Problem in Windows Agent: Eventlog monitoring
	does now also work, if first record has not number 1
	(relevant for larger/older eventlogs)
      * Fixed bug in administration.html: Filename for Nagios
	must be named check_mk.cfg and *not* main.mk. Nagios
	does not read files without the suffix .cfg. 
      * magic factor for df, that allows to automatgically 
        adapt levels for very big or very small filesystems.
      * new concept of host tags simplyfies configuration.
      * IMPORTANT: at all places in the configuration where
	lists of hosts are used those are not any longer
	interpreted as regular expressions. Hostnames
	must match exactly. Therefore the list [ "" ] does
	not any longer represent the list of all hosts.
	It is a bug now. Please write all_hosts instead
	of [ "" ]. The semantics for service expressions
	has not changed.
      * Fixed problem with logwatch.php: Begin with
	<?php, not with <?. This makes some older webservers
	happy.
      * Fixed problem in check ipmi: Handle corrupt output
	from agent
      * Cleaned up code, improved inline documentation
      * Fixed problem with vms_df: default_filesystem_levels,
	filesystem_levels and df magic number now are used
	for df, vms_df and df_netapp together. Works now also
	when precompiled.
	
1.0.28:
      * IMPORTANT: the config file has been renamed from
	check_mk.cfg to main.mk. This has been suggested
	by several of my customers in order to avoid 
	confusion with Nagios configuration files. In addition,
	all check_mk's configuration file have to end in
	'.mk'. This also holds for the autochecks. The 
	setup.sh script will automatically rename all relevant
	files. Users of RPM or DEB installations have to remove
	the files themselves - sorry.
      * Windows agent supports eventlogs. Current all Warning
        and Error messages from 'System' and 'Application' are
        being sent to check_mk. Events can be filtered on the
	Nagios host.
      * Fixed bug: direct RRD update didn't work. Should now.
      * Fixed permission problems when run as root.
      * Agent is expected to send its version in <<<check_mk>>>
	now (not any longer in <<<mknagios>>>
      * Fixed bug in Windows agent. Performance counters now output
	correct values
      * Change checks/winperf: Changed 'ops/sec' into MB/s.
	That measures read and write disk throughput
	(now warn/crit levels possible yet)
      * new SNMP check 'ifoperstatus' for checking link
        of network interfaces via SNMP standard MIB
      * translated setup script into english
      * fixed bug with missing directories in setup script
      * made setup script's output nicer, show version information
      * NEW: mk_logwatch - a new plugin for the linux/UNIX agent
	for watching logfiles
      * Better error handling with Nagios pipe
      * Better handling of global error: make check_mk return
	CRIT, when no data can retrieved at all.
      * Added missing template 'check_mk_pingonly' in sample
	Nagios config file (is needed for hosts without checks)
	
1.0.27:
      * Ship source code of windows agent
      * fix several typos
      * fix bug: option --list-hosts did not work
      * fix bug: precompile "-C" did not work because
	of missing extension .py
      * new option -U,--update: It combines -S, -H and
	-U and writes the Nagios configuration into a
	file (not to stdout).
      * ship templates for PNP4Nagios matching most check_mk-checks.
	Standard installation path is /usr/share/check_mk/pnp-templates
	
1.0.26:
      -	Changed License to GNU GPL Version 2
      * modules check_mk_admin and check_mk_base are both shipped
	uncompiled.
      * source code of windows agent togehter with Makefile shipped
	with normal distribution
      * checks/md now handles rare case where output of /proc/mdstat
	shows three lines per array

1.0.25:
      * setup skript remembers paths

1.0.24:
      * fixed bug with precompile: Version of Agent was always 0

1.0.23:
      * fixed bug: check_config_variables was missing in precompiled
	files
      * new logwatch agent in Python plus new logwatch-check that
	handles both the output from the old and the new agent

1.0.22:
      * Default timeout for TCP transfer increased from 3.0 to 60.0
      * Windows agent supports '<<<mem>>>' that is compatible with Linux
      * Windows agents performance counters output fixed
      * Windows agent can now be cross-compiled with mingw on Linux
      * New checktype winperf.cpuusage that retrieves the percentage
	of CPU usage from windows (still has to be tested on Multi-CPU
	machine)
      * Fixed bug: logwatch_dir and logwatch_groupid got lost when
	precompiling. 
      * arithmetic for CPU usage on VMS multi-CPU machines changed

1.0.21:
      * fixed bug in checks/df: filesystem levels did not work
	with precompiled checks

1.0.20:
      * new administration guide in doc/
      * fixed bug: option -v now works independent of order
      * fixed bug: in statgrab_net: variable was missing (affected -C)
      * fixed bug: added missing variables, imported re (affected -C)
      * check ipmi: new option ipmi_summarize: create only one check for all sensors
      * new pnp-template for ipmi summarized ambient temperature
 
1.0.19:
      * Monitoring of Windows Services
      * Fixed bug with check-specific default parameters
      * Monitoring of VMS (agent not included yet)
      * Retrieving of data via an external programm (e.g. SSH/RSH)
      * setup.sh does not overwrite check_mk.cfg but installs
	the new default file as check_mk.cfg-1.0.19
      * Put hosts into default hostgroup if none is configured
